My solutions to the VE482 (Introduction to Operating Systems) Challenges, which is a modified version of the Eudyptula Challenges. 

The intention of this README is merely to document requirements for each challenge and the results, if applicable. The actual code for each challenge is in its own directory, with a README for how I solved it and resources used along the way.

------------------------------------------

Challenge 1:

Write a Linux kernel module, and stand-alone Makefile, that when loaded prints to the kernel debug log level, “Good morning ve482!”. Be sure to make the module be able to be unloaded as well.
The Makefile should build the kernel module against the source for the currently running kernel, or, use an environment variable to specify what kernel tree to build it against.

Results:

journalctl --since "1 minute ago" | grep "ve482" > README

Sep 17 18:37:15 xarch kernel: Good morning ve482!
Sep 17 18:37:22 xarch kernel: exit by ve482.

------------------------------------------

Challenge 2:

The tasks for this round is:
Download Linus’s latest git tree from git.kernel.org.
Build it, install it, and boot it. Ensure CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO=y is enabled.

Results:

sudo dmesg | grep "Linux version"
